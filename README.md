Goal - Build a modern data warehouse with mySQL, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics.

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio! 

This repository showcases a complete, end-to-end data solution—bridging the gap between raw data engineering and actionable business intelligence. Built to demonstrate industry-standard best practices, this project covers everything from architecting a robust data warehouse to delivering high-impact insights.

**Data Architecture**

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

**Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

**Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

**Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

 **Project Requirements**
 
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

---

**Specifications**
**Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

**Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

**Objective**

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior
Product Performance
Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
